# CustomToken

The CustomToken project is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity that implements a basic ERC-20 token with additional functionalities. It leverages the OpenZeppelin library for ERC-20 implementation and ownership control through the Ownable contract.

## Description

The CustomToken contract provides a customizable ERC-20 token named "CustomToken" with the symbol "CTK." The initial supply of 300 tokens is minted to the deploying address. It includes functions for minting new tokens (restricted to the owner), transferring tokens, and burning tokens.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this smart contract, you can simply copy the code from CustomToken.sol and deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain using your preferred development environment or platform.

### Executing program

* Deploy the CustomToken contract on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
* Provide the initial owner's address during deployment.
* Interact with the contract using the Ethereum wallet of the owner address to mint, transfer, and burn tokens.
